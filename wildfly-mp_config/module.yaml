      description: Absolute path to a directory whose contents should be converted to a Microprofile Config ConfigSource. File names within the directory are converted to configuration keys and the file contents are the associated values. An expected use of this setting would be to mount a ConfigMap to a volume and then use the mount point of that volume as the value for MICROPROFILE_CONFIG_DIR, thus converting the ConfigMap into a ConfigSource.
